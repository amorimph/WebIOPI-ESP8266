# WebIOPI-ESP8266
Implementation of ESP8266 modules as clients to be used with WebIOPi generated server.

This project was originally intended as a Home Automation system simulation. It uses WebIOPi to generate a server on a local IP network, also providing the HTML, CSS and Javascript files for Web page implementation. The ESP8266 was implemented as a client to this system, sending requests to the server every 200ms and changing its state acording to the user selection. A PiCamera was also included - a real-time streaming server was created on another port.

There's still a long way to go. But, even though all the code here still needs to be improved or optimized, the system is functional and can be tested.
